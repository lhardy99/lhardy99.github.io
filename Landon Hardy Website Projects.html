        The biggest and most successful project Landon has worked on and completed is his database project. <br />With his team 3's Company, Landon created a database from scratch. <br />
        Starting at the conceptual processes, the database was constructed all the way to a fully working system on the University of Arkansas' Walton system. <br /> This semester Landon is working on two projects, one for Hobby Lobby, and another for American Fidelity.
